            <h2> About Jay Burkholder </h2>
            <p>Born in Charlotte, NC, I grew up learning and loving media of all forms. Kid to a photographer and given ample opportunities to use cameras and computers,
                I slowly gained invaluable experience in multimedia and video creation over the years. I am currently finishing a degree in Media Studies (B.A.) with a minor in Information Systems and New Media and Design from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). 
                <br>
                <br>
                I currently work in collegiate Esports as an admin, broadcaster, observer, coach, manager, and multimedia professional. Skilled in graphic design, video editing, videography, cinematography, and broadcast production, I have worked many live sports and Esports broadcasts as well as freelance multimedia gigs. 
                I run my own videography company: J Films LLC. as a means of income. I also create short films and YouTube videos with a small group of dedicated crew and actors under the production name of Be Kind Films.
